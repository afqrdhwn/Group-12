## Introduction
Docker is an open source containerization platform. It allows developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies needed to run that code in any environment. Containers simplify the delivery of distributed applications and are gaining popularity as organizations move to cloud-native development and hybrid multicloud environments. Docker is essentially a toolkit that allows developers to build, deploy, run, update, and stop containers using simple commands and labor-saving automation through a single API.

Now people might go thinking that Docker is the same as virtual machines such as Oracle Virtual Machine. There is a huge difference between Docker and other virtual machines. Virtual machines create a sub-machine inside an already existing machine and the sub-machines are provided their owh HDD space, memory and processing powers which are obtained from the base machine. There, developers can create, explore and experiment with their applications without affecting the base machine's system. Docker on the other hand, create components which are provided resources such as libraries which allows developers to do the exact same process they do on virtual machines.
