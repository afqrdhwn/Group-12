## Introduction
Docker is an open source containerization platform. It allows developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies needed to run that code in any environment. Containers simplify the delivery of distributed applications and are gaining popularity as organizations move to cloud-native development and hybrid multicloud environments. Docker is essentially a toolkit that allows developers to build, deploy, run, update, and stop containers using simple commands and labor-saving automation through a single API.
